# Project in Data Science: 
# Sleep & Productivity Analytics: Patterns and Predictions
Sleep plays a crucial role in overall well-being, yet many people, especially students, struggle 
with maintaining a healthy sleep cycle. Personally, I have experienced sleep issues that have 
negatively affected my mood, stress levels, and daily productivity. This challenge is not unique to 
me, I believe many students face similar problems due to academic pressure, irregular 
schedules, and lifestyle habits.

I have always been interested in how mood and stress are influenced by sleep and daily habits. 
This project allows me to explore these relationships using data-driven insights.

Understanding these connections is important, as poor sleep quality impacts academic 
performance, mental health, and productivity. By analyzing this dataset, I hope to uncover 
insights that can help students and other people improve their well-being.
