# KMeans Clustering and PCA-Based Model Performance Evaluation
This project evaluates the performance of KMeans clustering on multi-class data with slight class imbalance. Using Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) as the evaluation metric, it assesses the alignment between true labels and assigned cluster labels. PCA visualization is employed to reduce dimensionality and enable clear, scatterplot-based visualization of cluster-to-label mappings, enhancing interpretability.

## Datasets

- This project utilize dataset "[df_file.csv]" sourced from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanishqdublish/text-classification-documentation?resource=download)).
